Using NLTK to run an analysis on the Harry Potter corpus - talk at Codeland 2018 in NYC.

Thank you for visiting the repo!

If you want to see a walk through of all of the code, check out the `bossy.ipnb` file.

This project formed the basis of talks at:
- [Codeland](http://codelandconf.com/speakers/eleanor-stribling/) on May 5, 2018 in NYC ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de2AQRuqa0w))
- [DjangoCon US](https://2018.djangocon.us/talk/a-bossy-sort-of-voice-uncovering-gender/) on October 15, 2018
- [PyCon Canada](https://2018.pycon.ca/talks/talk-PC-55247/) on November 10, 2018

This [blog post](https://medium.com/agatha-codes/a-bossy-sort-of-voice-3c3a18de3093) is a narrative of the inspiration for the talk and the process.  New posts with explanations of the code will be available shortly.

The slides (in Keynote, with animations!) are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EZJD87HgGWOnakj6lG308fNSECr_Qoyf/view?usp=sharing).
