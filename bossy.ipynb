    "\n",
    "The sexism critique of the Harry Potter novels is not a new one - many people have (written)[https://www.bustle.com/articles/136244-the-5-least-feminist-moments-in-harry-potter] excellent articles about Ron's treatment of Hermoine, the portrayl of other female characters as cold or incompetent or promiscuous.  But there were two types of analyses I didn't see: a quantitative or linguistics based one, or something that looked at how the author herself portrays female characters in a biased light in how they speak\n",

    "My hope in doing this is that people will use some of these tools to look more critically at the language of literature we love and the popular press for signs of gender, racial, and other bias."

    "For this project, I will examine where the narrator's descriptions of all female characters indicates a sexist bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first books, I noticed the problematic language the most in descriptions of Hermoine, so in my first iterations of the project I focused there.  However, as I read more I noticed that the same issues applied to descriptions of other female characters, so I decided to expand my scope to all female characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also decided to focus on how JK Rowling, the author, describes characters, rather than how the characters describe themselves or talk about, or to, one another.  The reason for this is that the sexism I've found problematic in the books isn't so much what the characters express - and my argument here isn't that Harry Potter should not explore bias or any \"-ism\" through its characters - but more that the way they are portrayed by the author is problematic.  For this reason, my analysis omits dialog and focuses on the narrarator's voice.\n"

    "After some searching, I found a couple of excellent lists.  Because the Harry Potter series is written in English by a British writer, I focused on sources from the UK and countries in the Commonwealth.  Using this blog post by a [New Zealand blogger](http://sacraparental.com/2016/05/14/everyday-misogyny-122-subtly-sexist-words-women/) I had a first set of words and some excellent categories to begin with.  I found a number of [other](http://time.com/4268325/history-calling-women-shrill/) excellent articles about sexism in language, which I used to add to the `sexist_words` Python dictionary below."
